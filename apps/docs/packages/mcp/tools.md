## Cloud management tools

| Tool | Safety | Purpose |

## Safety annotations

Each tool carries a `safety` label:
- **read** — Read-only, safe to call without user approval
- **write** — Mutates memory, should require explicit user authorization

The server also supports a global `--read-only` flag that blocks all write tools.
