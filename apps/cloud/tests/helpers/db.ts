/**
 * File-backed libSQL test database, migrated from the committed Drizzle migration.
 *
 * Tests need a real database to exercise the actual SQL the handlers emit — a
 * mock would only assert the calls we hand-wrote, not the query the ORM builds.
 * Each test gets an isolated, zero-latency libSQL DB under a fresh OS temp dir
 * that is created + torn down per test (no shared state, no cleanup harness).
 *
 * ## Why a temp FILE, not `:memory:`
 * The cloud concurrency layer (ADR 0010) runs commits inside interactive
 * `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions (`db.$client.transaction("write")`). The
 * native `libsql` driver that backs `:memory:` has a quirk: after such a
 * transaction commits, subsequent queries on the main client hit a SEPARATE
 * empty in-memory database and fail with "no such table". A file-backed URL
 * (`file:<tmp>/test.db`) keeps a single database instance across the connection
 * and the transaction, so the production serialization primitive behaves in
 * tests exactly as it does against Turso over HTTP. Each `createTestDb` call
 * uses a unique temp dir, so isolation is preserved.
 *
 * The schema is applied by running each committed `drizzle/*.sql` migration,
 * split on Drizzle's `--> statement-breakpoint` marker. Reading the files at
 * test time (not hard-copying the DDL) keeps the test schema in lock-step with
 * the migration the Worker actually deploys — drift fails the test, not a deploy.
