/**
 * Cloud write serialization — ADR 0010.
 *
 * The single cloud replica (`project_files` + `sync_cursors`) must stay
 * consistent under concurrent multi-agent writes (the B3 "one memory, many
 * agents" model). Without serialization, two `push/complete` calls racing on
 * `bumpCursor` (a `max(seq)+1` read-then-write) can land the same `seq`, and a
 * commit interleaved with another loses a manifest entry — silently, the D6
 * "last-writer-wins" trust bug.
 *
 * Fix: wrap every manifest mutation in a libSQL **interactive write
 * transaction** (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`). libSQL queues concurrent write
 * transactions rather than rejecting them (see `@libsql/core` api.d.ts: the
 * server "cannot process multiple write transactions concurrently, so if there
 * is another write transaction already started, our transaction will wait in a
 * queue before it can begin"). That queue makes the per-project commit path
 * strictly serial with zero application-level locking.
 *
 * ## Why not drizzle's `db.transaction()`?
 * Drizzle's libSQL session starts transactions with **no mode argument**
 * (`session.js` → `client.transaction()`), which defaults to `"deferred"`. A
 * deferred transaction upgrades to a write lock on first write, and that upgrade
 * "may fail if there is already a write transaction executing" — the exact
 * race we are trying to eliminate on a path that must never lose a commit. We
 * therefore reach below drizzle to `db.$client.transaction("write")` (raw
 * `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, the queueing primitive) and run the commit's statements
 * against that raw `Transaction` via `execute()`. This keeps the serialization
 * guarantee in one place and free of drizzle's mode-defaulting footgun.
 *
 * ## Lock scope
 * Project-scoped, not global: every `push/complete` acquires the lock for its
 * own `projectId`. Two different projects commit concurrently with no
 * contention. The lock is on the **metadata/manifest** only — blob bytes live
 * in R2 and are content-addressed (the sha is the key), so uploads never need
 * this lock.
 *
 * ## Failure classification
 * The libSQL interactive-transaction lock-acquisition step has a timeout
 * (≈5s). If the queue is still full at the timeout (a long-running commit, or
 * pathological contention), the transaction throws `"database is locked"`. We
 * surface that as `ConcurrencyError` (503 + `Retry-After`) so the client
 * retries the same `push/complete` idempotently. Every other throw
 * (`ConflictError`, `EntitlementError`, …) passes through unchanged.
 *
 * @see docs/adr/0010-cloud-concurrency-control-for-b3.md
 * @see ./shared.ts `commitPushTx` — the work run inside the lock.
