/**
 * Shared sync internals — project loading, cursor math, manifest diffing.

 * §4.3) and `sync_cursors` (the monotonic per-project ordering token, §4.3).
 * This module is the pure-data-access + diff layer the routes compose; the
 * routes themselves own HTTP, presigning, and envelope shaping.

 * Kept free of Hono / Worker concerns so it is unit-testable with an in-memory
 * DB and no request context.

 * @see docs/architecture/cloud-sync-and-refactor.md §4 — file-replication sync.
 * @see docs/architecture/decisions.md Q13 — auto-provision on first push.

/**
 * Commits a push inside a caller-supplied libSQL write transaction (ADR 0010).
 *
 * This is the serialized form: the caller wraps the call in
 * `acquireWriteLock(db, projectId, (tx) => commitPushTx(tx, projectId, …))`, so
 * every statement below runs against the SAME `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction.
 * The cursor bump + N upserts + SUM + projects update are atomic by
 * construction — there is no window for a concurrent commit to interleave and
 * lose a manifest entry or collide on `seq`.
 *
 * Statements run as raw SQL via `tx.execute()` because the raw libSQL
 * `Transaction` (not a drizzle db handle) is what the `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` lock
 * holds. Drizzle's query builder operates on `Database`/sessions, not raw
 * transactions; mixing would either lose the lock or require drizzle's own
 * (deferred-mode) transaction wrapper — see `concurrency.ts` for why deferred
 * is wrong on the commit path. The SQL mirrors the drizzle queries the old
 * `commitPush` emitted (same columns, same `ON CONFLICT(project_id, path)` upsert).
 *
 * @param tx         an open libSQL write transaction from `acquireWriteLock`.
 * @param projectId  the project being committed.
 * @param uploaded   the verified `{ path, sha256, r2Key, sizeBytes }` entries.
 * @returns `{ cursor, manifest }` — the new cursor and the full cloud manifest
 *          after the commit, shaped exactly as `SyncPushCompleteResult` expects.
 *
 * ## Why `total_storage_bytes` is recomputed from `project_files`, not incremented
 * The naïve approach is `total += delta`. That drifts on a push that *replaces*
 * a path's blob (old bytes freed, new bytes added) or that touches a path the
 * project already held. Recomputing `SUM(size_bytes) WHERE project_id = ?` after
 * the upserts is a single indexed aggregation and is always correct regardless
 * of how many paths were added/replaced/deleted. Deletes (a path the client no
 * longer lists) are handled implicitly: a push that drops a path doesn't upsert
 * it, but also doesn't delete the row — deletion is explicit via a future
 * `DELETE /sync/file` (§13 out of v1 scope); v1 sync is append/replace by sha.
