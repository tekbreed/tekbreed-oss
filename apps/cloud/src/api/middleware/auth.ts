/**
 * Bearer-token authentication middleware.
 *
 * Authenticates `/v1/projects/:projectId/sync/*` requests (§12.4) against the
 * `api_keys` table: the raw `tm_…` key is salted-hashed to
 * `sha256(salt + ":" + rawKey)` and looked up. The cloud NEVER stores raw keys —
 * only the hash (`api_keys.key_hash`, ADR 0006). On a hit, the middleware loads
 * the owning account and stamps it on `c.var.account` so downstream handlers
 * resolve ownership + entitlements without re-querying.
 *
 * Validation chain (§12.4 "Validated for hash, revocation, ownership, scopes,
 * entitlements, rate limits"):
 *   1. **Present + well-formed** — `Authorization: Bearer tm_…`, else 401.
 *   2. **Hash lookup** — a row exists in `api_keys` with matching `key_hash`,
 *      else 401 (same error code as missing — never reveal key-vs-format).
 *   3. **Not revoked** — `revoked_at IS NULL`, else 401.
 *   4. **Ownership** — the key's account owns the `:projectId` in the path; this
 *      is enforced per-route in the sync handlers (P2.3) where the project is
 *      loaded, not here — the middleware authenticates the *account*, routes
 *      authorize the *project*. (Split keeps the middleware reusable across
 *      project-scoped and account-scoped routes.)
 *   5. **Scope** — v1 ships a single scope (`memory:sync`); every live key has
 *      it implicitly. No `scopes` column yet — the scope gate is a no-op until a
 *      second capability is added, at which point a `scopes` column lands. This
 *      is intentional pre-launch minimalism, not a missing feature.
 *   6. **Entitlements + rate limits** — entitlements (402) are enforced on the
 *      mutating push path (P2.4); rate limiting is a separate cross-cutting
 *      layer (Upstash Redis, deferred). Neither is an auth concern.
 *
 * The middleware is factory-built (`createAuthMiddleware(db, salt)`) so tests
 * can inject an in-memory DB + literal salt without Worker bindings; the route
 * layer constructs it once per request from `createDb(env)` + `env` salt.
 *
 * @see docs/architecture/cloud-sync-and-refactor.md §12.4 — auth contract.
 * @see apps/cloud/src/server/sha256.ts — `hashApiKey` (salted sha256, Web Crypto).
