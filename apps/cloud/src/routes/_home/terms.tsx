				<code className="rounded bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 font-mono text-xs text-foreground">

				files and mirrors them across your devices. It does not run the memory

		h: "2. The open-source runtime",

			<p>
				The TekMemo runtime (the local engine) is open-source software licensed

		body: (
			<p>
				You must provide accurate information and keep your credentials secure.

				Your synced files and metadata persist until you delete them. Deleting

		body: (
			<p>
				We strive for high availability but provide the service on a
				best-efforts basis. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features with
				reasonable notice. Because your memory always lives locally as plain
				files, interruptions to the cloud never destroy your data.

				To the maximum extent permitted by law, TekBreed is not liable for

				preceding twelve months.
