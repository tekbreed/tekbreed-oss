/**
 * Privacy policy (SC2).
 *
 * A real, product-grounded v1 privacy policy — not boilerplate. It reflects the
 * locked architecture: the cloud stores METADATA ONLY (Turso) + content-
 * addressed file blobs (R2); it never parses, embeds, indexes, or runs recall
 * on user memory. Payment data is handled by Polar (Merchant of Record), not
 * us. Connector tokens are encrypted server-side and never synced to files.
 *
 * This is a living legal document; final wording should be reviewed by counsel
 * before launch, but the data-flow facts below are derived from the shipped
 * architecture (ADR 0005, ADR 0006, cloud-sync-and-refactor.md §12.2).
