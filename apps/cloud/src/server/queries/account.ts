 * in-memory `createTestDb()` harness.
 *
 * `getAccountForUser` is the extracted DRY counterpart of the inline join that
 * lived in `session.server.ts` (now both call here): one `accounts.userId`
 * lookup returning the entitlement snapshot. `getAccountUsage` aggregates the
 * storage total across the account's projects — the same number the sync push
 * path recomputes per-project, rolled up account-wide.
 *
 * @see docs/adr/0006-pricing-and-entitlements.md — entitlement caps.
 * @see {@link ./projects} — per-project reads compose the same tables.
