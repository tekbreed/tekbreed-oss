/**
 * Magic-link request rate limiting (SC4.1 defense).
 *
 * Passwordless auth turns the inbox into the only factor, so the
 * request-magic-link endpoint is a prime abuse vector (inbox flooding, list
 * bombing, enumeration). This module caps it per-IP via Upstash Redis using a
 * sliding window. Upstash is REST-based so it runs in the Worker without a TCP
 * socket (unlike the Turso driver, which has its own fetch transport).
 *
 * Graceful degradation: when the Upstash env is unset (local dev, or an env
 * that hasn't provisioned Redis yet) the limiter resolves to `null` and callers
 * fall through to the normal path — auth still works, just un-throttled. This
 * keeps the local `pnpm dev` flow dependency-free.
 *
 * @see docs/adr/0005-cloud-tech-stack.md — Upstash as the rate-limit store.
