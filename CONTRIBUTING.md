# Contributing to TekMemo

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TekMemo.

TekMemo is an open-source memory runtime for AI apps and agents. The project is designed to be useful to external developers, not only TekMemo Cloud.

This guide explains how to contribute code, docs, examples, tests, and package improvements.

---

## Project goals

TekMemo aims to provide:

- file-first memory infrastructure
- provider-neutral memory contracts
- vector recall adapters
- reranking adapters
- graph memory
- connector ingestion
- MCP support
- cloud-sync client contracts
- observability hooks
- evaluation and benchmark utilities

The public OSS repo should remain:

- open-source friendly
- BYOK-friendly
- cloud-optional
- provider-neutral where possible
- testable with fake clients
- easy to understand
- safe to use in production

feat
fix
docs
test
refactor
perf
chore
ci
build
```

---

## Pull request checklist

Before opening a pull request, verify:

* [ ] The change has a clear purpose.
* [ ] The package boundary is respected.
* [ ] Tests were added or updated.
* [ ] Edge cases were considered.
* [ ] Public APIs are documented.
* [ ] TypeScript passes.
* [ ] Build passes.
* [ ] Formatting/lint checks pass.
* [ ] A changeset was added if a package changed.
* [ ] No secrets, tokens, credentials, or private cloud logic were committed.

---

## Package boundary rules

Each package should own one concern.

Examples:

```txt
tekmemo
  Core contracts and memory records.

@tekbreed/tekmemo-fs
  Filesystem-backed storage.

@tekbreed/tekmemo-recall
  Provider-neutral recall contracts.

@tekbreed/tekmemo-upstash-vector
  Upstash Vector adapter.

@tekbreed/tekmemo-agentfs
  AgentFS adapter.

@tekbreed/tekmemo-ai-sdk
  AI SDK integration.
```

Packages in this OSS repo must not contain private TekMemo Cloud logic such as:

* tenant routing
* subscription enforcement
* billing state
* usage gates
* encrypted BYOK storage
* internal admin tooling
* private dashboard composition
* production cloud database ownership

---

## Adding a new package

A standard package should follow this structure:

```txt
packages/package-name/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── types.ts
│   ├── errors.ts
│   └── internal/
├── tests/
├── docs/
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│   └── EDGE_CASES.md
├── examples/
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── tsdown.config.ts
```

The package should include:

* a clear README
* TypeScript types
* tests
* edge-case tests
* examples if useful
* no unnecessary dependencies
* a small public API
* stable package exports
* clear errors

---

## Public API rule

The public API should be exported from:

```txt
src/index.ts
```

Avoid deep imports like:

```ts
import { something } from "@tekbreed/tekmemo-recall/dist/internal/something";
```

If something is public, export it intentionally.

If something is internal, keep it internal.

---

## Edge-case expectations

Production packages should handle:

* invalid input
* empty input
* duplicate IDs
* malformed JSON
* invalid metadata
* circular values
* prototype-pollution keys
* unsafe paths
* unsafe URLs
* timeout/cancellation where applicable
* retries where applicable
* large payloads
* partial failures
* provider failures
* rate limits
* missing optional config
* deterministic behavior in tests

Do not only test the happy path.

---

## TypeScript expectations

Use strict TypeScript.

Prefer explicit types for public APIs.

Avoid:

```ts
any
```

unless there is a clear reason.

Prefer:

```ts
unknown
```

at package boundaries, then validate.

Public functions should make invalid states difficult to represent.

---

## Testing expectations

Every package should have tests for:

* normal behavior
* invalid input
* boundary conditions
* error behavior
* edge cases
* provider/client failures where applicable

Run all tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run tests for a package:

```bash
pnpm --filter @tekbreed/tekmemo-package-name test
```

---

## Documentation expectations

Each package should explain:

* what it does
* what it does not do
* installation
* basic usage
* advanced usage if relevant
* edge cases
* package boundaries
* examples
* production notes

Avoid vague package docs.

A developer should be able to understand why the package exists and how to use it.

---

## Examples expectations

Examples should be:

* small
* runnable
* focused
* documented
* safe by default

Do not require paid providers unless the example is clearly provider-specific.

Provider examples should support environment variables, not hardcoded keys.

Bad:

```ts
apiKey: "sk_live_..."
```

Good:

```ts
apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
```

---

## Changesets

If your change affects a package that will be published, add a changeset:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Choose the correct bump:

```txt
patch  -> bug fixes and small improvements
minor  -> new features that do not break existing users
major  -> breaking changes
```

Examples:

```txt
patch:
Fix JSONL parser recovery behavior.

minor:
Add weighted path traversal to graph memory.

major:
Rename public recall adapter interface.
```

When changesets are versioned (`pnpm version-packages`), each package's `CHANGELOG.md` is updated and the root [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) is regenerated with a release-oriented summary of all public package changes.

---

## Dependency rules

Keep dependencies minimal.

Before adding a dependency, ask:

* Is it necessary?
* Is it maintained?
* Is it safe?
* Is it small?
* Does it work in the runtime targets?
* Can this be implemented simply without a dependency?
* Will it cause problems for users bundling the package?

Avoid dependencies for tiny utilities.

---

## Runtime compatibility

Packages should clearly state their intended runtime.

Possible targets:

```txt
Node.js
Browser
Cloudflare Workers
Bun
Deno
Edge runtimes
```

Do not accidentally introduce Node-only APIs into packages that should work in edge or browser environments.

---

## Environment variables

Do not read environment variables deep inside generic packages unless the package is explicitly an adapter that needs provider config.

Prefer this:

```ts
createOpenAIEmbeddingAdapter({
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```

Avoid this inside the adapter:

```ts
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

This keeps packages testable and runtime-flexible.

---

## Security rules

Never commit:

* API keys
* tokens
* credentials
* `.env` files
* production database URLs
* private certificates
* session secrets
* customer data
* private TekMemo Cloud internals

Use `.env.example` for documented configuration.

---

## Documentation site

The public docs app lives in:

```txt
apps/docs
```

Run it locally:

```bash
pnpm --filter docs dev
```

Slides live in:

```txt
apps/slides
```

Run the demo deck:

```bash
pnpm --filter slides dev
```

---

## Issue guidelines

When opening an issue, include:

* package name
* version
* runtime
* reproduction steps
* expected behavior
* actual behavior
* logs or stack traces if relevant
* minimal reproduction if possible

Good title:

```txt
@tekbreed/tekmemo-fs: JSONL parser skips valid line after malformed object
```

Bad title:

```txt
Bug
```

---

## Feature request guidelines

For feature requests, include:

* problem statement
* use case
* proposed API if relevant
* alternatives considered
* package affected
* whether it should be OSS or cloud-only

---

## Pull request review criteria

Maintainers will review:

* package boundary
* correctness
* API design
* tests
* docs
* edge cases
* security
* maintainability
* performance impact
* dependency impact

A smaller focused PR is easier to review than a large mixed PR.

---

## Release philosophy

TekMemo should release stable, well-tested packages.

Do not rush a package into public release if:

* API boundaries are unclear
* tests are weak
* docs are missing
* edge cases are not handled
* package responsibility is too broad

It is acceptable for a package to exist in the repo before public release.

---

## Getting help

Use GitHub issues or discussions for:

* bugs
* feature requests
* design questions
* package usage questions
* documentation improvements

For security issues, follow `SECURITY.md`.

## Thank you

Every useful issue, test, doc fix, example, and bug report helps make TekMemo better.
