# Contributing to TekBreed OSS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TekBreed OSS.

This repository hosts TekBreed open-source work. TekMemo is the first product family: an open-source memory runtime for AI apps and agents. The project is designed to be useful to external developers, not only TekMemo Cloud.

This guide explains how to contribute code, docs, tests, and package improvements.

---

## Project goals

TekMemo aims to provide:

- file-first memory infrastructure
- provider-neutral memory contracts
- vector recall capabilities
- reranking capabilities
- graph memory
- connector ingestion
- MCP support
- cloud client contracts
- observability hooks
- evaluation and benchmark utilities

The public OSS repo should remain:

- open-source friendly
- BYOK-friendly
- cloud-optional
- provider-neutral where possible
- testable with fake clients
- easy to understand
- safe to use in production

## Pull request checklist

Before opening a pull request, verify:

* [ ] The change has a clear purpose.
* [ ] The package boundary is respected.
* [ ] Tests were added or updated.
* [ ] Edge cases were considered.
* [ ] Public APIs are documented.
* [ ] TypeScript passes.
* [ ] Build passes.
* [ ] Formatting/lint checks pass.
* [ ] A changeset was added if a package changed.
* [ ] No secrets, tokens, credentials, or private cloud logic were committed.

---

## Package boundary rules

Each product package should own one concern. TekMemo is one unified package where all public APIs are exported from `@tekbreed/tekmemo`.

Internally, code is organized by feature area (such as `fs`, `recall`, `agentfs`, `ai-sdk`, etc.), but these are not exposed as separate package entrypoints. All public features are imported directly from `@tekbreed/tekmemo`.

Packages in this OSS repo must not contain private TekMemo Cloud logic such as:

* tenant routing
* subscription enforcement
* billing state
* usage gates
* encrypted BYOK storage
* internal admin tooling
* private dashboard composition
* production cloud database ownership

---

## Adding a new package or feature

- **TekMemo features**: Add all new TekMemo capabilities as internal modules under `packages/tekmemo/src/<feature>/` and re-export them from the package root [index.ts](file:///Users/codingsimba/Desktop/projects/oss/packages/tekmemo/src/index.ts). Do not create separate adapter packages or introduce public subpath imports.
- **New workspace packages**: Future workspace packages (such as TekCode components) should live beside `packages/tekmemo/` under `packages/<package-name>/` and conform to the following directory structure:

```txt
packages/package-name/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── types.ts
│   ├── errors.ts
│   └── internal/
├── tests/
├── docs/
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│   └── EDGE_CASES.md
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── tsdown.config.ts
```

The package should include:

* a clear README
* TypeScript types
* tests
* edge-case tests
* no unnecessary dependencies
* a small public API
* stable package exports
* clear errors

---

## Public API rule

The public API should be exported from:

```txt
src/index.ts
```

Avoid deep imports. Since everything is exported from the root entrypoint `@tekbreed/tekmemo`, import directly from `@tekbreed/tekmemo`.

If something is public, export it intentionally.

If something is internal, keep it internal.

---

## Edge-case expectations

Production packages should handle:

* invalid input
* empty input
* duplicate IDs
* malformed JSON
* invalid metadata
* circular values
* prototype-pollution keys
* unsafe paths
* unsafe URLs
* timeout/cancellation where applicable
* retries where applicable
* large payloads
* partial failures
* provider failures
* rate limits
* missing optional config
* deterministic behavior in tests

Do not only test the happy path.

---

## TypeScript expectations

Use strict TypeScript.

Prefer explicit types for public APIs.

Avoid:

```ts
any
```

unless there is a clear reason.

Prefer:

```ts
unknown
```

at package boundaries, then validate.

Public functions should make invalid states difficult to represent.

---

## Testing expectations

Every package should have tests for:

* normal behavior
* invalid input
* boundary conditions
* error behavior
* edge cases
* provider/client failures where applicable

Run all tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run tests for a product package:

```bash
pnpm --filter @tekbreed/tekmemo test
```

---

## Documentation expectations

Each package should explain:

* what it does
* what it does not do
* installation
* basic usage
* advanced usage if relevant
* edge cases
* package boundaries
* production notes

Avoid vague package docs.

A developer should be able to understand why the package exists and how to use it.

## Changesets

If your change affects a package that will be published, add a changeset:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Choose the correct bump:

```txt
patch  -> bug fixes and small improvements
minor  -> new features that do not break existing users
major  -> breaking changes
```

Examples:

```txt
patch:
Fix JSONL parser recovery behavior.

minor:
Add weighted path traversal to graph memory.

major:
Rename public recall adapter interface.
```

When changesets are versioned (`pnpm version-packages`), both individual package changelogs and the root `CHANGELOG.md` are updated by Changesets.

---

## Dependency rules

Keep dependencies minimal.

Before adding a dependency, ask:

* Is it necessary?
* Is it maintained?
* Is it safe?
* Is it small?
* Does it work in the runtime targets?
* Can this be implemented simply without a dependency?
* Will it cause problems for users bundling the package?

Avoid dependencies for tiny utilities.

---

## Runtime compatibility

Packages should clearly state their intended runtime.

Possible targets:

```txt
Node.js
Browser
Cloudflare Workers
Bun
Deno
Edge runtimes
```

Do not accidentally introduce Node-only APIs into packages that should work in edge or browser environments.

---

## Environment variables

Do not read environment variables deep inside generic packages unless the package is explicitly an adapter that needs provider config.

Prefer this:

```ts
createOpenAIEmbeddingAdapter({
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```

Avoid this inside the adapter:

```ts
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

This keeps packages testable and runtime-flexible.

---

## Security rules

Never commit:

* API keys
* tokens
* credentials
* `.env` files
* production database URLs
* private certificates
* session secrets
* customer data
* private TekMemo Cloud internals

Use `.env.example` for documented configuration.

---

## Documentation site

The public docs app lives in:

```txt
apps/docs
```

Run it locally:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

---

## Issue guidelines

When opening an issue, include:

* package name
* version
* runtime
* reproduction steps
* expected behavior
* actual behavior
* logs or stack traces if relevant
* minimal reproduction if possible

Good title:

```txt
@tekbreed/tekmemo: fs JSONL parser skips valid line after malformed object
```

Bad title:

```txt
Bug
```

---

## Feature request guidelines

For feature requests, include:

* problem statement
* use case
* proposed API if relevant
* alternatives considered
* package affected
* whether it should be OSS or cloud-only

---

## Pull request review criteria

Maintainers will review:

* package boundary
* correctness
* API design
* tests
* docs
* edge cases
* security
* maintainability
* performance impact
* dependency impact

A smaller focused PR is easier to review than a large mixed PR.

---

## Release philosophy

TekMemo should release stable, well-tested packages.

Do not rush a package into public release if:

* API boundaries are unclear
* tests are weak
* docs are missing
* edge cases are not handled
* package responsibility is too broad

It is acceptable for a package to exist in the repo before public release.

---

## Getting help

Use GitHub issues or discussions for:

* bugs
* feature requests
* design questions
* package usage questions
* documentation improvements

For security issues, follow `SECURITY.md`.

## Thank you

Every useful issue, test, doc fix, example, and bug report helps make TekMemo better.
