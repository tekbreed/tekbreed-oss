# TekMemo — Canonical Execution Roadmap

_Created: 2026-05-02_

## 1. Purpose

This document is the canonical execution roadmap for building:

- **TekMemo OSS**
- **TekMemo Cloud**

It sequences:

- package work
- cloud app work
- infrastructure work
- database work
- API work
- pricing and billing work
- design work
- launch work

This roadmap is designed to prevent building things in the wrong order.

It assumes:

- React Router v7
- Cloudflare Workers
- Turso
- Upstash Vector
- Voyage and OpenAI embeddings
- VitePress for docs
- one cloud app serving both UI and API

---

# 2. Core build principle

Build in this order:

1. **core runtime**
2. **local and hosted adapters**
3. **cloud app foundations**
4. **multi-tenant control plane**
5. **memory product flows**
6. **recall pipeline**
7. **usage, billing, and API productization**
8. **design polish and launch**

Do not start by polishing the dashboard before the memory runtime and data architecture are stable.

Do not start by building enterprise features before the Developer, Pro, and Team paths work.

Do not start by building too many integrations before the chunk registry and recall pipeline are solid.

---

# 16. Minimum viable release cut

If you need to cut scope aggressively, your first serious release should include:

## Required
- projects
- core memory
- notes
- conversations
- basic recall
- API keys
- Developer + Pro plans
- usage summary
- hard caps on free
- one embedding provider
- one vector provider
- pricing page
- docs app

## Can wait slightly
- Team roles depth
- webhooks
- advanced analytics
- enterprise features
- multiple embedding providers in UI
- advanced restore UX
- add-on self-serve automation

---

# 17. Things not to build too early

Do **not** prioritize these before the core loop works:

- enterprise-only auth
- marketplace integrations
- too many provider options in UI
- custom branding/white-labeling
- deep analytics dashboards
- excessive changelog/blog polish
- multiple cloud apps
- secondary database platforms

---

# 18. Canonical recommendation

The right execution order is:

1. monorepo and package boundaries
2. TekMemo OSS packages
3. cloud app structure
4. control-plane DB and auth
5. project + memory loop
6. recall + chunk registry
7. usage + pricing + billing
8. API productization
9. design/docs alignment
10. beta launch and hardening

This is the canonical roadmap for building TekMemo and TekMemo Cloud.
