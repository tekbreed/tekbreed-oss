# TekMemo — BYOK and OSS Policy

## 1. BYOK definition

BYOK means **Bring Your Own Key**.

The user provides credentials for an external provider, such as:

- Voyage
- OpenAI
- Upstash
- Turso
- Qdrant
- Pinecone
- Cohere
- Jina

TekMemo packages should accept these keys as configuration.

TekMemo packages should not store provider secrets.

# 4. OSS policy

## Open source
All provider-neutral packages and provider adapters should be OSS.

## Closed source
TekMemo Cloud should remain closed.

Closed parts:
- billing
- quotas
- hosted BYOK encrypted storage
- tenant provider routing
- dashboard
- internal admin
- support tools

## Why
The OSS packages drive adoption.

The cloud product drives revenue.
