# TekMemo Benchmarking and Production Testing Strategy

_Last updated: 2026-05-04_

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how TekMemo should be tested, benchmarked, load-tested, and validated before production deployment.

TekMemo is not a normal CRUD app. It is memory infrastructure for AI apps and agents. That means ordinary unit tests are not enough.

A production-grade TekMemo release must prove all of these:

1. **Correctness** — memory reads, writes, updates, forgetting, sync, indexing, and recall behave correctly.
2. **Isolation** — user, project, workspace, tenant, and session memory never leak across boundaries.
3. **Retrieval quality** — recall returns the right memories, not just any semantically similar text.
4. **Temporal correctness** — newer facts override older facts when appropriate.
5. **Conflict handling** — contradicted memories are detected, deprecated, or surfaced safely.
6. **Cost control** — free tiers, indexing, embeddings, reranking, and vector search do not burn money unexpectedly.
7. **Latency** — reads, writes, recall, indexing, and API routes stay within acceptable limits.
8. **Failure safety** — provider failures, malformed files, corrupt JSONL, rate limits, and partial writes do not destroy memory state.
9. **Observability** — every important operation can be traced and debugged.
10. **Regression control** — every release can be compared against previous benchmark baselines.

---

## 2. Benchmarking philosophy

TekMemo should not claim it beats competitors until the claim is measurable.

The benchmark strategy should prove this positioning:

> TekMemo gives developers local-first, inspectable, file-backed memory with measurable recall quality, latency, cost, and failure behavior.

The benchmark system should be built before public claims. Public claims should include:

- dataset used
- runner version
- embedder used
- vector store used
- reranker used
- graph expansion settings
- memory compiler settings
- hardware/runtime environment
- cold/warm cache status
- latency percentiles
- cost estimate
- failure behavior

---

## 3. Recommended repo structure

Add this to the TekMemo monorepo:

```txt
apps/
├─ cloud/
├─ docs/
└─ benchmarks/

packages/
├─ tekmemo/
├─ fs/
├─ ai-sdk/
├─ agentfs/
├─ upstash/
├─ voyage/
├─ openai/
├─ rerank/              # future
├─ graph/               # future
├─ connectors/          # future
├─ cloud-sync/          # future
└─ benchmark-kit/
```

### Why `packages/benchmark-kit`?

`packages/benchmark-kit` contains reusable benchmark logic:

- metric calculations
- benchmark runners
- dataset loading
- report generation
- cost estimation
- release gates
- fake retrievers
- adapter contract helpers

### Why `apps/benchmarks`?

`apps/benchmarks` is the executable app:

- local CLI runner
- datasets
- k6 load tests
- reports
- CI entrypoints
- staging production checks

This split keeps benchmark logic reusable while keeping execution scripts in one place.

## 4. Test pyramid for TekMemo

TekMemo needs more than one test layer.

```txt
Unit tests
  ↓
Contract tests
  ↓
Integration tests
  ↓
Golden dataset benchmarks
  ↓
Long-memory benchmarks
  ↓
Cost benchmarks
  ↓
Cloud API load tests
  ↓
Production smoke tests
```

### 4.1 Unit tests

Unit tests validate pure package logic.

| Package | Unit test focus |
|---|---|
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo` | memory paths, manifests, events, chunk registry, conflict detection, memory compiler primitives |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-fs` | path resolution, safe read/write/append, missing files, path traversal protection |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-ai-sdk` | tool schema validation, command mapping, safe memory injection |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-agentfs` | root resolution, sync hooks, leases, checkpoint behavior |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-upstash` | namespace resolution, metadata filters, hit mapping, dimension validation assumptions |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-voyage` | batching, request mapping, dimension validation, malformed responses |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-openai` | model validation, dimensions support, request mapping, empty input handling |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-rerank` | deterministic ranking, score normalization, fallback behavior |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-graph` | entity extraction boundaries, temporal edges, invalidation, graph expansion |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-connectors` | cursor state, dedupe, source manifest, retryable ingestion |
| `@tekbreed/tekmemo-cloud-sync` | sync manifest, conflict resolution, idempotency, offline recovery |

### 4.2 Contract tests

Contract tests are shared test suites that every adapter must pass.

Example:

```txt
MemoryStore contract
├─ InMemoryMemoryStore
├─ NodeFsMemoryStore
├─ AgentFsMemoryStore
└─ CloudSyncMemoryStore
```

The point is simple: if two adapters implement `MemoryStore`, they must behave the same way for core behavior.

Required contracts:

| Contract | Implementations |
|---|---|
| `MemoryStoreContract` | in-memory, fs, agentfs, cloud-sync |
| `MemoryVectorStoreContract` | in-memory vector test store, Upstash adapter, future providers |
| `MemoryEmbedderContract` | fake embedder, Voyage, OpenAI |
| `RerankerContract` | deterministic reranker, provider rerankers |
| `ConnectorContract` | GitHub, file folder, Notion, Slack, future connectors |
| `SyncStoreContract` | local sync, AgentFS, Cloud sync |

### 4.3 Integration tests

Integration tests verify package combinations.

Required integration combinations:

```txt
tekmemo + @tekbreed/tekmemo-fs
tekmemo + @tekbreed/tekmemo-fs + @tekbreed/tekmemo-ai-sdk
tekmemo + @tekbreed/tekmemo-fs + @tekbreed/tekmemo-voyage + @tekbreed/tekmemo-upstash
tekmemo + @tekbreed/tekmemo-fs + @tekbreed/tekmemo-openai + @tekbreed/tekmemo-upstash
tekmemo + @tekbreed/tekmemo-graph + @tekbreed/tekmemo-rerank
tekmemo + @tekbreed/tekmemo-connectors + @tekbreed/tekmemo-cloud-sync
```

Integration tests should have two modes:

| Mode | Purpose | Runs on every PR? |
|---|---|---:|
| Fake client mode | deterministic, free, fast | Yes |
| Real provider smoke mode | validates provider integration | No; manual/nightly only |

---

## 5. Retrieval benchmark metrics

TekMemo recall must be measured with retrieval metrics, not opinions.

### 5.1 Recall@K

Recall@K answers:

> Did at least one expected memory appear in the top K results?

Example:

```txt
Query: What database did we choose for TekMemo Cloud?
Expected: mem_turso_decision
Top 5 returned: mem_turso_decision, mem_cloudflare, mem_pricing...
Recall@5 = 1
```

### 5.2 Precision@K

Precision@K answers:

> How many of the top K results were actually relevant?

If top 5 contains 2 expected memories:

```txt
Precision@5 = 2 / 5 = 0.4
```

### 5.3 MRR

MRR means Mean Reciprocal Rank.

It rewards systems that place the first correct answer near the top.

```txt
Correct result at rank 1 → 1.0
Correct result at rank 2 → 0.5
Correct result at rank 5 → 0.2
No correct result       → 0
```

### 5.4 nDCG@K

nDCG rewards ranking quality when multiple relevant memories exist.

Use it later when benchmark cases include graded relevance:

```txt
high relevance = 3
medium relevance = 2
low relevance = 1
irrelevant = 0
```

### 5.5 Forbidden return rate

This is extremely important for TekMemo.

A memory system must not return outdated or forbidden facts.

Example:

```txt
Old fact: The app uses Express.
New fact: The app migrated to Hono.
Query: What framework does the app use now?
Forbidden return: Express
Expected return: Hono
```

### 5.6 Stale return rate

This measures how often TekMemo returns deprecated or superseded memories.

```txt
staleReturnRate = staleResultsReturned / totalQueries
```

### 5.7 Abstention accuracy

This measures whether TekMemo avoids pretending it knows something when memory has no supporting evidence.

Example:

```txt
Query: What CRM does this customer use?
Memory: no CRM information
Correct behavior: return no confident answer / low-confidence context
```

---

## 6. Benchmark datasets TekMemo needs

Start with small handcrafted datasets. Later, expand to public and larger datasets.

### 6.1 Developer-agent dataset

Purpose:

- test developer memory
- project decisions
- preferences
- architecture recall

Example cases:

```txt
What database did we choose?
What hosting platform are we using?
What does the user prefer for API implementation?
```

### 6.2 Conflict dataset

Purpose:

- test old fact vs new fact
- test deprecation
- test temporal ordering

Example:

```txt
Old: Project uses Express.
New: Project migrated to Hono.
Expected answer: Hono.
Must not return as current truth: Express.
```

### 6.3 Temporal update dataset

Purpose:

- test facts that change over time
- test latest-state recall
- test event ordering

Example:

```txt
April 1: Cloud beta planned for May.
May 2: Cloud beta moved to June.
Query: When is cloud beta planned now?
Expected: June.
```

### 6.4 Repo-aware memory dataset

Purpose:

- test package, route, config, and architecture memory
- test codebase-specific recall

Example:

```txt
Query: Where are memory adapters implemented?
Expected: packages/fs, packages/agentfs, packages/upstash
```

### 6.5 Connector ingestion dataset

Purpose:

- test imported source documents
- test source provenance
- test dedupe
- test deleted/updated source handling

### 6.6 Cloud sync dataset

Purpose:

- test sync conflicts
- test offline edits
- test idempotent push/pull
- test restore points

---

## 7. Reranking benchmark plan

Reranking should be added after basic retrieval is stable.

The full recall pipeline should eventually look like this:

```txt
query
  → keyword retrieval top 50
  → vector retrieval top 50
  → graph expansion top 20
  → merge and dedupe candidates
  → rerank top 20
  → memory compiler top 5
  → prompt-ready context
```

### 7.1 What to measure

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Pre-rerank Recall@10 | How much good context raw retrieval found |
| Post-rerank MRR | Whether reranking moved correct memories upward |
| Post-rerank nDCG@10 | Whether ranking quality improved |
| Latency delta | Extra time added by reranker |
| Cost delta | Extra money added by reranker |
| Fallback success | Whether recall still works if reranker fails |

### 7.2 Reranker failure rule

Reranker failure must never break recall.

Required behavior:

```txt
If reranker succeeds:
  use reranked candidates

If reranker fails:
  log failure
  return deterministic merged retrieval results
  mark result metadata.rerankerStatus = "failed_fallback"
```

---

## 8. Graph memory benchmark plan

Graph memory should be tested separately from vector recall.

### 8.1 Graph metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Entity precision | Extracted entities are correct |
| Entity recall | Important entities were extracted |
| Edge precision | Relationships are correct |
| Temporal edge correctness | Latest relationship is selected correctly |
| Invalidation accuracy | Old relationships are deprecated |
| Graph expansion usefulness | Expanded nodes improve recall |

### 8.2 Graph benchmark example

```json
{
  "events": [
    { "text": "TekMemo Cloud uses Turso for relational data." },
    { "text": "TekMemo Cloud uses Upstash Vector for recall." },
    { "text": "TekMemo Cloud stores snapshots in R2." }
  ],
  "query": "What infrastructure does TekMemo Cloud use?",
  "expectedEntities": ["TekMemo Cloud", "Turso", "Upstash Vector", "R2"],
  "expectedEdges": [
    ["TekMemo Cloud", "uses", "Turso"],
    ["TekMemo Cloud", "uses", "Upstash Vector"],
    ["TekMemo Cloud", "stores snapshots in", "R2"]
  ]
}
```

---

## 9. Cost benchmark plan

TekMemo needs cost benchmarks because the free tier must not destroy the business.

Track cost per operation:

| Operation | Cost metric |
|---|---|
| Memory write | cost per 1,000 writes |
| Indexing | cost per 1,000 chunks |
| Embedding | cost per 1,000 texts or tokens |
| Vector upsert | cost per 1,000 chunks |
| Recall query | cost per 1,000 queries |
| Reranking | cost per 1,000 rerank calls |
| Cloud sync | cost per 1,000 sync events |
| Connector ingestion | cost per 1,000 documents |

Every production benchmark report should include:

```json
{
  "estimatedCost": {
    "per1000WritesUsd": 0.01,
    "per1000IndexOpsUsd": 0.12,
    "per1000RecallQueriesUsd": 0.08
  }
}
```

### 9.1 Free-tier safety

Developer Cloud Free should have hard caps:

```txt
1 user
1 project
storage cap
indexing cap
recall cap
API key cap
retention cap
no expensive add-ons
```

But local testing remains free:

```txt
local file memory = $0 TekMemo cost
local keyword recall = $0 TekMemo cost
BYO provider semantic recall = user pays provider
hosted cloud semantic recall = TekMemo cost, gated by caps
```

---

## 10. API load testing plan

Use k6 for cloud API testing.

Required test types:

| Test | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Smoke | Confirms critical routes work under tiny load |
| Average-load | Tests expected normal traffic |
| Stress | Pushes beyond expected traffic |
| Spike | Tests sudden traffic bursts |
| Soak | Tests stability over long duration |

### 10.1 Endpoints to test

```txt
GET  /api/v1/health
GET  /api/v1/me
GET  /api/v1/projects
POST /api/v1/projects
GET  /api/v1/projects/:projectId/memory/core
PUT  /api/v1/projects/:projectId/memory/core
POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/notes
POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/recall/query
POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/index
GET  /api/v1/usage
```

### 10.2 Metrics to track

```txt
p50 latency
p95 latency
p99 latency
error rate
429 rate
auth failure correctness
database latency
vector store latency
embedding provider latency
queue delay
cold start rate
```

### 10.3 Beta targets

| Metric | Target |
|---|---:|
| API error rate | `< 1%` |
| p95 non-AI API latency | `< 300ms` |
| p95 recall API latency | `< 1500ms` |
| p95 memory read latency | `< 250ms` |
| p95 memory write latency | `< 500ms` |
| indexing job success | `> 99%` |
| auth failure correctness | `100%` |

---

## 11. Observability plan

Before production, every critical operation must emit structured telemetry.

Track these spans:

```txt
tekmemo.memory.read
tekmemo.memory.write
tekmemo.memory.append
tekmemo.memory.event.append
tekmemo.index.chunk
tekmemo.embed.batch
tekmemo.vector.upsert
tekmemo.vector.query
tekmemo.rerank
tekmemo.graph.expand
tekmemo.compiler.build_context
tekmemo.sync.pull
tekmemo.sync.push
tekmemo.api.auth
tekmemo.api.quota_check
```

Every operation should include:

```json
{
  "tenantId": "ten_...",
  "projectId": "proj_...",
  "operation": "recall.query",
  "requestId": "req_...",
  "durationMs": 143,
  "status": "ok",
  "provider": "upstash",
  "costUnit": 1
}
```

Minimum logs:

| Event | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `memory.write.started` | Debug user memory changes |
| `memory.write.completed` | Confirm durability |
| `memory.write.failed` | Support debugging |
| `recall.query.started` | Trace recall latency |
| `recall.query.completed` | Inspect retrieval quality |
| `recall.query.failed` | Provider failure debugging |
| `quota.exceeded` | Cost control |
| `auth.failed` | Security auditing |
| `sync.conflict_detected` | Data integrity |
| `indexing.job.failed` | Recall correctness |

---

## 13. Production release gates

Before production, every release must pass:

```txt
[ ] typecheck passes
[ ] lint passes
[ ] unit tests pass
[ ] contract tests pass
[ ] integration tests pass
[ ] package builds pass
[ ] coverage threshold passes
[ ] benchmark baseline does not regress beyond allowed limits
[ ] k6 smoke test passes
[ ] auth tests pass
[ ] quota tests pass
[ ] migration tests pass
[ ] rollback path tested
[ ] observability emits request IDs
[ ] cost estimate updated
```

### 13.1 Suggested thresholds

| Area | Minimum gate |
|---|---:|
| Core package coverage | `90%+` |
| Adapter package coverage | `85%+` |
| Cloud service coverage | `80%+` |
| Critical auth/quota logic | `95%+` |

```

---

## 15. Public benchmark strategy

Do not publish vague claims.

Bad:

```txt
TekMemo has the best memory.
```

Better:

```txt
TekMemo reached 92% Recall@5 and 0.81 MRR on our public developer-agent memory benchmark using local files, OpenAI embeddings, Upstash Vector, and deterministic reranking.
```

A public benchmark page should include:

```txt
dataset
query count
memory count
embedding provider
vector database
reranker
graph mode
memory compiler mode
hardware/runtime
latency percentiles
cost estimate
failure cases
benchmark code link
```
