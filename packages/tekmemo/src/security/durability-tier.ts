/**
 * @file Durability tier — write intelligence layer 2 (ADR 0009 Component 6).
 *
 * @remarks
 * Where the {@link ./secret-blocklist} gate *rejects* writes outright, the
 * durability tier decides *how long a written memory should influence
 * retrieval*. Two levels:
 *
 * - **`durable`** — indexed into the recall store + graph. Surfaced by
 *   `tekmemo.recall` / `tekmemo.context`. The memory that shapes future
 *   sessions.
 * - **`transient`** — written to `notes.md` (the audit trail) and visible in
 *   `list_recent_memories`, but **never indexed**. It does not pollute
 *   retrieval. Scratch, working state, low-confidence guesses.
 *
 * This is the **memweave thesis** — files as source of truth, derived index
 * disposable — applied to writes. The file keeps everything that passes the
 * blocklist; the disposable recall index + graph prune by tier. A transient
 * memory is recoverable: a human editing `notes.md`, or a future promotion op,
 * can make it durable; the index rebuilds.
 *
 * ### Distinct from `kind`
 *
 * `kind` answers "what *is* this fact?" (`decision`, `constraint`, `note`).
 * `tier` answers "how long should it steer retrieval?" A `decision` is almost
 * always durable; a `note` is almost always transient — but a high-confidence
 * `note` capturing a real fact should be durable, and a low-confidence
 * `decision` drafted mid-session should be transient. Both dimensions carry
 * signal; the classifier reads both.
 *
 * ### Deterministic floor + adapter hook (the invariant)
 *
 * The zero-config classifier ({@link classifyDurability}) is deterministic — it
 * runs with no API key and makes defensible calls from `kind` + `confidence` +
 * content shape. It is wrong sometimes (a terse `decision` that's actually
 * transient, a `note` that's actually a durable fact). The LLM/`Extractor`
 * adapter, when configured, re-scores — but the deterministic floor is the
 * honest price of zero-config: file-first + rebuildable index means the failure
 * mode is "slightly noisier retrieval," never "lost memory."
 *
 * @see ADR 0009 Component 6 — write intelligence (blocklist + durability tier).
